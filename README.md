# India Air Quality Index (AQI) & Demographics Visualization

This project visualizes real-time air quality data (AQI) across India using ArcGIS Online. It overlays population projections and state demographics to identify pollution hotspots and population exposure risks, offering insight for environmental policy and planning.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To visualize and analyze India's air pollution levels using AQI data, and understand their relationship with population density and demographics.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Platform:** ArcGIS Online (Public Account)
- **Data Sources:**
  - AQI Data: Likely sourced from CPCB or OpenAQ
  - Administrative Boundaries & Demographics: ArcGIS Living Atlas
- **Visualization Features:**
  - Smart Mapping with graduated symbols
  - Layer styling and thematic overlays
  - Legend for AQI and population insights

## 🗺️ Map Layers

- **AQI Points:** Red circles with varying radii to indicate pollution severity
- **Industries/Pollution Sources (Optional):** Yellow triangle markers
- **India State Boundaries:** Styled base map
- **Population Projections:** State-level population data from ArcGIS Living Atlas
- **Labels:** State names and surrounding countries

## 🔍 Visual Insights

- Jharkhand shows large AQI symbols, highlighting it as a pollution hotspot
- Populated states show overlapping patterns of demographic density and air quality
- Thematic mapping allows comparison between pollution and state-level metrics

## 🚫 Deployment Status

> ✅ Published and shared via ArcGIS Online.  
> ❌ No backend or local server; created entirely using ArcGIS public account features.
